# LLDBagility

LLDBagility is a tool for macOS kernel debugging that allows to connect LLDB to any macOS virtual machine running on a patched version of the VirtualBox hypervisor, thanks to the capabilities of virtual machine introspection offered by the Fast Debugging Protocol (FDP).

For more information, read the accompanying blog posts:

- [An overview of macOS kernel debugging](https://blog.quarkslab.com/an-overview-of-macos-kernel-debugging.html)
- [LLDBagility: practical macOS kernel debugging](https://blog.quarkslab.com/lldbagility-practical-macos-kernel-debugging.html)

## Features

LLDBagility implements a set of new LLDB commands that allows the debugger to:

- attach to running macOS VirtualBox virtual machines and debug their kernel, stealthily, without the need of changing the guest OS (e.g. no necessity of DEVELOPMENT or DEBUG kernels, boot-args modification or SIP disabling) and with minimal changes to the configuration of the VM;
- interrupt (and later resume) the execution of the guest kernel at any moment;
- set hardware breakpoints anywhere in kernel code, even at the start of the boot process;
- set hardware watchpoints that trigger on read and/or write accesses of the specified memory locations;
- save and restore the state of the VM in a few seconds.

These commands are intended to be used alongside the ones already available in LLDB, like `register read`, `memory write`, `breakpoint set` (for software breakpoints), `step` and all the others. Furthermore, in case the Kernel Debug Kit of the debugged kernel is available for use (and possibly even when it isnâ€™t), the vast majority of lldbmacros also work as expected when loaded in the debugger.

## Requisites

- A recent version of macOS as host OS
- A recent version of the LLDB debugger (can be installed with e.g. `xcode-select --install`)
- The kdputils Python package (see the dedicated [README](kdputils/README.md))
- A working build of VirtualBox with the FDP patch for macOS hosts, along with the PyFDP bindings (see the dedicated [README](FDP/README.md))
- A VirtualBox VM with any version of macOS as guest OS, along with a copy of the guest macOS kernel binary (not needed if the guest has the same kernel of the host, or if the Kernel Debug Kit of the guest kernel is installed in the host)

Note that both packages PyFDP and kdputils must be installed for the Python interpreter used by LLDB.

## Installation

Assuming all requisites are satisfied, simply add `command script import <path-to-LLDBagility>/LLDBagility/lldbagility.py` to `~/.lldbinit`.

## Usage

1. Start the macOS virtual machine to debug and LLDB;
2. (required only if the kernel binary of the guest is different from the kernel of the host and no KDK for the guest kernel is installed in the host) in LLDB, execute the command `target create <path-to-guest-kernel-binary>`;
3. in LLDB, execute the command `fdp-attach <name-of-macos-vm>` to start debugging the VM.

The new LLDB commands implemented by LLDBagility are:

- `fdp-attach` or `fa`, to connect the debugger to a running macOS VirtualBox virtual machine;
- `fdp-hbreakpoint` or `fh`, to set and unset read/write/execute hardware breakpoints;
- `fdp-interrupt` or `fi`, to pause the execution of the VM and return the control to the debugger (equivalent to `sudo dtrace -w -n "BEGIN { breakpoint(); }"` );
- `fdp-save` or `fs`, to save the current state of the VM;
- `fdp-restore` or `fr`, to restore the VM to the last saved state.

In the debugger, use `help <command>` and `<command> -h` to see the command usage, like:

```bash
(lldb) help fdp-attach
     For more information run 'help fdp-attach'  Expects 'raw' input (see 'help raw-input'.)

Syntax: fdp-attach

    Connect to a macOS VM via FDP.
    The VM must have already been started.
    Existing breakpoints are deleted on attaching.
    Re-execute this command every time the VM is rebooted.

(lldb) fdp-attach -h
usage: fdp-attach [-h] vm_name

positional arguments:
  vm_name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

## Notes to users

- As per current FDP limitations, in the VirtualBox settings set the macOS VM to use one CPU only and less or equal than 2 GB of RAM
- Do not connect multiple instances of LLDBagility to the same macOS VM at the same time
- If the macOS VM reboots (for any reason), re-execute `fdp-attach` (the kernel slide changes and LLDB is not aware of this)
- If debugging seems slow or intermittent, disable App Nap in the macOS host
- Pause the kernel execution before setting software breakpoints or LLDB will complain
- Pause the kernel execution before setting hardware breakpoints with `fdp-hbreakpoint` or LLDB will return `Invalid expression`
- Preferably load lldbmacros after attaching, otherwise the error `FATAL FAILURE: Unable to find kdp_thread state for this connection.` is raised (and some macros breaks)
